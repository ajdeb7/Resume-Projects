This program represents a prototype for a potential application that connects modern professionals in real time in the same general vicinity. 
When is the last time you connected with your 500 LinkedIn connections? This application intends to create spontaneous, face-to-face connections 
for like-minded people. For the purpose of this prototype/demo, we have created a txt file with sample data about example users. We have created a
UserCollection object as a database for all Users in the vicinity. This program reads in this file and creates the collection of users before launching 
our GUI interface. The interface displays a series of question to learn information about the User in order to more carefully match them with other nearby Users.
